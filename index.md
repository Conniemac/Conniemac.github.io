## Computer Science Society Attendance Application

### About the Application
  The purpose of this project is to give the Computer Science Society a better way to keep attendance at our weekly meetings. 
Using an Excel spreadsheet creates a long line to sign in and is not the easiest to analyze. My program will cut down on sign 
in time and make it easier for the administrators to get information from the attendance list. Instead of searching 

### Technologies Used
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- JavaFX / FXML (GUI)

### How it Works
- The user is prompted to enter their first and last name (Valid characters are a-z and A-Z) <br>

  - They are asked to enter basic information, their major and email

  - If their major is vaild (contains only ' ', a-z and A-Z) and the email is also valid (contains only a-z, A-Z, '.' and a single '@') the user is asked to confirm the info they entered
